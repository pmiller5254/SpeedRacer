# speedrace.io

Welcome to Speedrace.io, the #1 place to record your speedrunning stats for every game out there.

On our site, a user will be able to create a profile, with which they will interact with our wide index of games, most commonly sorted by highest amount of entries. They will also be able to add a profile image, games they would like to follow, other SpeedRacers they may like to follow, and have the ability to make entries. These entries will be shown on the view page for each game, or the profile page for each user, they are associated with. 

Entries will be small, card-like elements which contain information about the gamer (their SpeedRacer profile, twitch/twitter/youtube links, etc.), the game being played, links to the stream where it happened, a short description of the circumstances surrounding the video, and the completion statistics such as time, percentage, hits taken, etc. These entries can be about anything from Super Mario 64 speedruns, to Dark Souls no damage runs, to World of Warcraft world-first boss kills!

In the future, the app will support video players (complete with timestamps) on the site to view the record breaking event and a moderation team to review and verify such entries.
